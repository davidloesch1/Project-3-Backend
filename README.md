#Process of Development
The approach we used were to separate the backend to the frontend and starting developing separatly each of the files. Also, were to add some testing to our code.

1. first step was to get our connection to the port 8080 after we imported all of our dependencies within Express.js.
2. making our connection using mongoose to our localhost db.
3. we created our two schema utilizing our pre-planning worksheet within our planning folders.
4. after setting up our schemas we were able to create our routes within the controllers folder based upon the schema (key : values pairs) we chose.
5. we added our routes files into the index.js file to see if you can access any uploads.
